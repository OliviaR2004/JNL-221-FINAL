        <p>Amidst a fierce political landscape, the acronym DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) has become a hot-button talking point for both sides of the aisle. Recent Trump administration <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/23/nx-s1-5374365/trump-signs-education-executive-actions">cuts and threats to higher education diversity programs</a>, have left many public and private institutions with more uncertainties than answers.</p>

        <p>Over the past few years <a href="https://www.suny.edu/about/">SUNY</a>, the public university system in New York State, has finally started seeing an <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/education/article/suny-campuses-cut-deficits-enrollment-increases-20177730.php">uptick in enrollment</a>. This follows a longstanding trend of falling enrollment across all types of SUNY schools. </p>

        <p>SUNY reached record low numbers of enrollment in the fall of 2022, but this wasn’t a surprise. SUNY schools had been seeing a steady decline in overall enrollment. Much of this has to do with the average ethnic makeup of a SUNY school. From 2010 to 2022, SUNY enrollment had dropped overall by nearly 25,000 students. Despite the fact that enrollment by hispanic/latino students had nearly doubled, this didn’t stop an overall drop in enrollment. </p>

</script>

        <p>Last year, the New York state comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli, looked into the issue of the link between SUNY enrollment and campus diversity. DiNapoli found that <a href="https://www.osc.ny.gov/press/releases/2024/03/dinapoli-new-yorks-public-and-private-colleges-and-universities-face-significant-challenges-years#:~:text=In%20large%20part%20due%20to,all%20SUNY%20institutions%20experienced%20increases.">demographic changes</a> had become a large factor in SUNY’s ability to attract students. The statement also named the COVID-19 pandemic as a factor. Social distancing, a strong job market, and a decreased number of students transferring from community colleges to higher education were all named as causes. Disadvantaged students were said to be on the major receiving end of these factors.

      <h2>Covid-19</h2>
      <p>The Covid-19 pandemic created a major barrier for minority students to attend SUNY schools. Temple University’s Hope Center reports that since the pandemic, college enrollment amongst the Black and Native American communities has <a href="https://hope.temple.edu/racial-disparities-basic-needs-insecurity-college-students-covid-19-pandemic"> dropped significantly</a>. Annenberg Brown University did a deep dive into the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on college attendance. The study found that certain types of schools were more prone to decreased attendance post-pandemic, than others.</p>

    <iframe title="Diversity in SUNY Colleges by School Type" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-7WV13" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7WV13/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="233" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}}))}();
</script>

      <p>However, community college attendance post-Covid saw a massive drop that disproportionately affected POC students. Reports saw a <a href="https://annenberg.brown.edu/sites/default/files/impact_of_covid_on_college_ongoing.pdf">36% decline</a> for low-income Black, Latinx, and Indigenous student enrollment in community college. The pandmeic financially hurt Black and Brown students more than others, yet SUNY's response to this inequity fell short of what was necesary.  During the pandemic, SUNY could only accept around 20% of it's 15,000 applicants to the <a href= "https://www.nysenate.gov/sites/default/files/admin/structure/media/manage/filefile/a/2025-02/united-university-professions-uup-.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Education Opporutnity Program</a> (EOP). This program was designed to help economically struggling students, and this usually consists of majority POC families.</p>
        

      <h2>SUNY Outreach</h2>
      <p>Another major barrier that minority students are facing with enrollment in SUNY schools is the systemic issues that SUNY is not addressing. Several SUNY schools participate in partnerships with many different New York highschools. This system is to help guide students to SUNY and prepare them for college life. The <a href ="https://www.suny.edu/attend/EarlyCollegePlanning/">SUNY Early College Pathways</a> suggest students with early college courses to give them a head start on their academic journey. However taking a closer look at the schools that SUNY partners with reveals a deeper truth about which students are granted opportunities. </p>

      <div class="photo-caption">High schools students being taught on a college campus. <em>SUNY Oneonta</em></div>

      <p>SUNY Oneonta is just one of the SUNY schools that participates in the ECP program. The school boasts partnerships with <a href="https://suny.oneonta.edu/admissions/extended-learning/college-high-school#:~:text=SUNY%20Oneonta's%20College%20in%20High,in%20development%20all%20the%20time"> over 30 school districts</a> across New York. However, of the 28 listed high schools Oneonta partners with, 16 are located in majority white neighborhoods and have a majority white student population. This means that the pipeline to early college access and access to SUNY resources is condensed to vastly white areas and schools.</p>

      <p>Even the schools that have higher diversity percentages are still plagued by barriers. Several ECP programs require students to pay fees for courses, books, and other miscellaneous fees. These price gaps disproportionately impact low-income minority students, preventing them from pariticpating in the program.</p>

      <h2>Campus Climate</h2>
      <p>Studies have shown that minority students are more likely to attend a university if it reflects their ethnic background or showcases diveristy in a signfiicant way. This is because there is a <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w18812">positive correlation between university-level diversity and future income</a>. SUNY’s recent history of falling enrollment could be attributed to the fact that the campus is not reflective of the broader population. <a href="https://www.suny.edu/media/suny/content-assets/documents/diversity/suny-dei-final-action-plan.pdf">A report by SUNY</a> shows that over half of SUNY’s overall staff and faculty are white. </p>  
      
       <p>Wesley Whiteside, the Associate Director of Recruitment and Diversity for Syracuse Univeristy’s Newhouse School of Public Communications, spoke about what diverserity looks like on a college campus. Fostering a diverse campus is all about opportunities. Allowing students, faculty, and staff a safe space to voice their opinions and concerns is crucial to uplifting all voices. Whiteside added that a particular strategy being taken on by SUNY schools has shown the benefits of not just a diverse student body, but a diverse faculty.</p>

       <p>The <a href="https://www.suny.edu/prodig-plus/">PRODiG+ program</a> is one of the four pillars of SUNY’s DEI program. PRODiG+(Promoting Recruitment, Opportunity, Diversity, Inclusion and Growth plus) creates a pipeline to allow over 400 post-doctorates to enter the SUNY tenure track. It aims to increase the number of diverse faculty members within the SUNY system.</p>

       <div class="photo-caption">SUNY Empire launches PRODiG+ program. <em>SUNY</em></div>

       <p>While there is still much work to be done, this past year SUNY has started to see its overall enrollment begin to rise. It's no surprise that this comes after the new diversity initatives, like PRODiG+, are finally starting to have substantial effect on SUNY campuses. Whiteside remains optimistic about the future of diversity on SUNY campuses, saying that as long as schools are willing to acknowledge that there is always room for improvement, things will get better. Open dialogue and accepting feedback from the campus community are what make a university strong and more accepting of diversity.</p>
